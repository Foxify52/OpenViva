## Copyrights

This repository is based on original Viva source code. Sir Hal shared
it publicly and gave us permissions to do whatever we want with it.
We decided to republish it under MIT licence. This repository does not
include assets from Unity Asset Store that were present in original source
code. We plan to find free alternatives for these assets or create our own.
